      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Weather Alerts Global, a service designed to keep you informed
        about significant weather events around the world. Our system monitors
        global weather alerts and presents them on an interactive map, giving
        you an easy way to see what's happening and where. You can also create
        custom alert notification zones, ensuring you're always in the loop for
        events that matter most to you. Whether it's a minor disturbance or an
        extreme event, we strive to deliver the most relevant information
        directly to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Key features of our service include:</h3>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Interactive Global Map:</h4>
        View current weather alerts overlaid directly on an interactive map.
        This allows you to see the scope of each alert at a glance and explore
        areas of interest. The map updates dynamically using WebSockets to give
        you the most up to date information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Customisable Alert Zones:</h4>
        Draw custom areas directly on the map where you want to be notified of
        alerts. You can create specific shapes to match your exact requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Real-time Notifications:</h4>
        When you create an alert zone, the system will check in real time for any
        events which may be relevant to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Email Alerts:</h4>
        Receive email notifications whenever an alert is active in your defined
        zones, or when a new alert zone is created. You have control over
        whether to turn these e-mail alerts on or off for each zone you create.
        You can also optionally request snapshots of alerts with e-mail.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Severity-Based Color Coding:</h4>
        Weather events are displayed with colors representing their severity to
        make it easier to identify the most critical alerts at first glance.
        The severity categories are Minor, Moderate, Severe and Extreme, this
        is based on the severity levels provided by the issuing authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Detailed Alert Information:</h4>
        You can click on any alert on the map to view detailed information,
        including the start and end times, descriptions, and instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Account Management:</h4>
        We provide secure account management features, so you can change your
        password and manage the information you provide in a secure manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Daily Automated Operations:</h4>
        A daily process occurs which handles data management such as removing old
        entries, and also checks for and sends alerts, as well as keeping the
        map up to date. The map data is checked for updates every 1 - 2 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to providing a simple and intuitive experience to keep
        you updated on weather conditions that matter.
